# UsefulFreeHomeServer

This installs a bunch of software on Debian-systems that makes it a useful server for at home

## More details

Specificially, this set up a Samba-Server on which there is an OCR-folder that, whatever you put
into it (JPG, PNG, PDF, ...), OCR's it and creates a searchable PDF.

More features to come!

## Operating Systems

This script was only tested to the latest Debian version, and may also work in Ubuntu. But I haven't 
tested that.

## Security

Right now, security is a mess here. It uses a default password and allows anybody to enter
anything. Thus, THIS IS NOT FOR PRODUCTION!
